leap describes both implicit and explicit `time stepping methods
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_stepping>`_. Methods are
described using a small virtual machine whose statements can
then be used to either generate code or simply execute the time
integrator.

Execution and code generation is provided by
`dagrt <https://gitlab.tiker.net/inducer/dagrt>`_. Further
supported operations include finding of stability regions, building
of companion matrices, and more.

leap is licensed under the MIT license.

leap requires Python 2.6 or newer.
